stupid
======

This repository is dedicated to traditional cardgame called stupid. It is implemented with Python
I am still very new in both programming and Python. This project will help me to improve my skills.
The development is going in a three way:

1. Automated play engine (random moves)
2. Human players
3. Card streght evaluation for human play assist
4. AI for playing game, with neural networks.
5. GUI
6. Online play
